# Aleix Bermúdez 🌐
Hi! My name is **Aleix Bermúdez**.  
I am a **Web Application Development** student passionate about technology and building digital solutions. I have worked on several personal projects that have helped me develop skills in languages like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL**, as well as frameworks like **React**.  

I enjoy taking on challenges that allow me to learn new technologies and improve my programming skills. I am continuously growing and looking for opportunities to apply what I've learned in professional environments. I adapt easily to new situations and thrive on finding solutions to complex problems.
