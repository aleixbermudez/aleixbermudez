# Aleix Bermúdez
  Hi! My name is Aleix Bermúdez.  
  I am a **Web Application Development** student passionate about technology and building digital solutions. I have worked on several personal projects that have helped me develop skills in languages like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL**, as well as frameworks like **React**. I enjoy taking on challenges that allow me to learn new technologies and improve my programming skills. I am continuously growing and looking for opportunities to apply what I've learned in professional environments.  
  I adapt easily to new situations and I am always ready to solve problems, no matter how complex they might be.
